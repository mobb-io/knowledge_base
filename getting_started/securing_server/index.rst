Securing Your Server
====================

In the `Getting Started <https://www.linode.com/docs/getting-started>`_ guide, you learned how to deploy Linux, boot your Linode, and perform some basic system administration tasks. Now it’s time to secure your Linode and protect it from unauthorized access. You’ll learn how to implement a firewall, SSH key pair authentication, and an automatic blocking mechanism called Fail2Ban. By the time you reach the end of this guide, your Linode will be protected from attackers.
