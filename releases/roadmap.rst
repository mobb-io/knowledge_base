The story so far
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The mobb.io team created in 2015 this wonderful knowledge base to help people solve problems. For this, we selected a set of settings, tips and tricks that will make developer's life easier.

In summary:

 * October 2015: Dependencies and SSD Cloud Hosting - `linode <https://www.linode.com/>`_.
 * October 2015: Docker, Docker-Machine and Docker-Compose - `docker <https://https://blog.docker.com/2015/02/orchestrating-docker-with-machine-swarm-and-compose/>`_.

What's next
~~~~~~~~~~~

The `issue list <https://github.com/mobb-io/knowledge_base/issues>`_ gives a detailed view of the immediate tasks, but our current broad priorities are:

 * Python, Django web framework
 * multi-language support
